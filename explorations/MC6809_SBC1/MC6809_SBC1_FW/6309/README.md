The Hitachi 6309 is a Motorola 6809 compatible microprocessor. It can
run 6809 code in emulation mode, or run in a native mode where it
supports additional registers and instructions.

These examples were taken from "The 6309 Book: Inside the 6309
Microprocessor", Second Edition, by Chris Burke.

They will build with either the asm6809 or lwasm cross-assemblers.

This is the source, documentation, and example for the Motorola MC6839
Floating Point ROM.

The source does not quite match the binary (the former has a 1980
copyright date and the latter 1982). I am not able to built it from
source because it requires some Motorola "structured assembler" that I
have not been able to find any references to. It could be ported to an
existing assembler (e.g. asm6809), but since the source is older than
the binaries, I have not attempted to do this.

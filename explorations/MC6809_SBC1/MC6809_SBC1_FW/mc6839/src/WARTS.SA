* THIS FILE CONTAINS THE KNOWN WARTS TO THE AUG 15TH
* TEST SITE RELEASE. MOST ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH
* TO ISSUE A 'PATCH' TO THE EPROMS AND CAN EASILY BE
* AVOIDED. IF A PATCH IS DEEMED DESIREABLE IT IS
* GIVEN HERE TOO.
*
PROBLEM 1:
   THE OUTPUT ROUTINE DOES NOT GENERATE A $0F FOR A
   NEGATIVE SIGN FOR AN EXPONENT OR FRACTION. INSTEAD
   IT GENERATES AN $FF.

   DATE FIXED:	20.AUG.80  /  G. STEVENS

   DESCRIPTION OF FIX:
	    INSERTED EQUATE IN BINSTR TO SET THE
   SIGN PROPERLY.
*
PROBLEM 2: FABS AND FNEG WILL RETURN GARBAGE OUT IF
   PASSED THEY ARE PASSED A DENORMALIZED NUMBER
   WITH THE 'NORM' BIT SET IN THE FPCB.

   DATE FIXED:	18.AUG.80  /  G. STEVENS

   DESCRIPTION OF FIX:
		FABS & FNEG NOW INVOKE THE COMPONENT
   ROUTINE RTAR2 TO MOVE THE ARGUMENT TO THE RESULT.
   THE REQUIRED CHECKS FOR THE APPARENT UNDERFLOW
   CONDITION ARE PERFORMED IN RTAR2.
*
PROBLEM 3: COMPARE OF AN UNORMAL ZERO WITH A NORMAL
   ZERO DOES NOT COMPARE EQUAL AS IT SHOULD.

   DATE FIXED:	 19.AUG.80  /  G. STEVENS

   DESRIPTION OF FIX:
		TABLE PROCEDURES FOR NOT NORMALIZED
   NUMBERS NOW CHECK FOR A TRUE ZERO AS A RESULT OF
   NORMALIZING AND INVOKE THE COMPARE ZERO PROCEDURE
   IF BOTH ARGUMENTS ARE ZERO.
*
PROBLEM 4: AN OVERFLOW WITH NOTRAP SOMETIMES RETURNS
   GARBAGE IN THE RESULT.

   DATE FIXED:	20.AUG.80  /  G. STEVENS

   DESCRIPTION OF FIX:
	     FIXED A TYPO IN UNFLNT THAT WAS CAUSING
   AN INCORRECT PARAMETER TO BE PASSED TO THE MOVE
   PROCEDURE.
*
PROBLEM 5: ONLY THE ADBIAS AND SUBIAS PROCEDURES SET
   THE UNDERFLOW AND OVERFLOW FLAGS THUS A NOTRAP
   UNDERFLOW OR OVERFLOW CONDITION IS NOT SIGNALED
   IN THE STATUS BYTE.

   DATE FIXED:	21.AUG.80  /  G. STEVENS

   DESCRIPTION OF FIX:
	    THE OVERFLOW AND UNDERFLOW FLAGS ARE
   NOW SET IN THE PROCEDURES THAT CHECK FOR OVERFLOW
   UNDERFLOW INSTEAD OF THE ONES THAT ADD AND SUBTRACT
   THE BIAS.
*
PROBLEM 6: THE TABLE PROCEDURE THAT HANDLES THE CASE
   OF DIVIDE BY A NORMAL ZERO SIGNALS AN INVALID OP.
   OF 17 AND RETURNS AN NAN IF THE DIV BY ZERO TRAP
   IS ENABLED. IT APPEARS THAT THIS IOP( 17 ) IS NOT
   NEEDED AND THAT THE RESULT OF A DIVISION BY ZERO
   NORMALIZED ZERO SHOULD ALWAYS BE A PROPERLY SIGNED
   INFINITY.

   DATE FIXED:	 G. STEVENS  /	21.AUG.80

   DESCRIPTION OF FIX: REMOVED ANY TEST FOR THE DIV
   TRAP FROM THE PROCEDURE DIVZER SO THAT IT ONLY
   RETURNS PROPERLY SIGNED INFINITIES.
*
PROBLEM 7: OUTS WILL GOES INTO AN INFINITE LOOP
   WHEN IT IS PASSED NOT NORMALIZED NUMBERS IN
   PARTICULAR AN UNNORMALIZED ZERO.

   DATE FIXED:	G. STEVENS  /  22.AUG.80

   DESCRIPTION OF FIX:
	  PUT A TRAP FOR UNNORMAL ZEROS AT THE
   START OF THE OUTS PROCEDURE, ALSO INSERTED THE
   CORRECT CONSTANTS FOR THE LOG10X OF THE SMALL
   NORMALIZED VALUES.
*
PROBLEM 8: ROUND DOES NOT SET THE INEXACT RESULT
   FLAG IF THE RESULT ACTUALLY REQUIRES ROUNDING.

   DATE FIXED:	 21.AUG.80  /  G. STEVENS

   DESRIPTION OF FIX:
	ADDED CODE TO ROUND TO SET THE INEXACT
   RESULT FLAG IN THE STATUS BYTE IN THE EVENT
   THAT ROUNDING IS REQUIRED.
*
PROBLEM 9: UNDERFLOW WILL NOT BE SIGNALED IF THE
   EXPONENT OF THE RESULT EQUALS EXACTLY THE
   MINIMUM EXPONENT - 1. SIMILARILY, OVERFLOW
   IS NOT SIGNALED IF THE RESULT EQUALS EXACTLY
   THE MAXIMUM EXPONENT + 1.

   DATE FIXED:	25.AUG.80  /  G. STEVENS

   DESCRIPTION OF FIX:
	  A NEW MINIMUM EXPONENT TABLE IS USED
   IN CHECK_UNDERFLOW & THE CONDITIONAL EXPRESSION
   IS USED IN CHECK_OVERFLOW.
*
PROBLEM 10: IF THE UNORDERED CONDITION OCCURS
   IN A PREDICATE COMPARE WHERE THE INPUT
   PREDICATE WAS = OR <> THEN THE UNORDERED
   BIT IN THE FPCB IS NOT SET.

   DATE FIXED:	26.AUG.80  /  G. STEVENS

   DESCRIPTION OF FIX:
	   INSERTED THE PROPER LOGIC IN STEP II OF
   COMPARE TO SET THE UNORDERED FLAG WHEN UNORDERED
   OCCURS.

*

PROBLEM 11: SOMETIMES BINDEC SETS THE INEXACT BIT WHEN
   THE RESULT WAS EXACT

   DATE FIXED:	26.AUG.80  /  G. STEVENS

   DESCRIPTION OF FIX:
	     DECIDED THAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARD
   THE RESULT OF BINDEC SHOULD NEVER BE EXACT AND THAT THE
   USER SHOULD BE AWARE OF THIS. GIVEN THIS THE INEXACT BIT
   IS NOW ALWAYS CLEARED UPON EXIT FROM BINDEC.

*
PROBLEM 12: TRAPPING NANS CAUSE ALL SORTS OF FUNNY THINGS
   TO HAPPEN. ALSO, THE STATUS BYTES IN THE FPCB ARE NOT
   SET AT THE TIME OF A TRAP INVOCATION.

   DATE FIXED: 8-26-80

   DESCRIPTION OF FIX: MOVE THE CODE IN FRNBAK THAT MOVES THE
      TEMPORARY STATUS FROM THE STACK FRAME TO THE FPCB FROM
      'CLSTAK' TO 'TRAP'. ALSO CLEAR TSTAT AFTER THE TRAP
      IS TAKEN.

*
PROBLEM 13: IOP 7 (P OR K) OUT OF RANGE DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY
   FOR EITHER BINDEC OR DECBIN.

   DATE FIXED: 8 - 27 - 80

   DESCRIPTION OF FIX: CHECK FOR P AND K OUT OF RANGE
      IF P IS OUT OF RANGE DO IOP=7 AND SET P=19.
      IF K IS OUT OF RANGE DO IOP=7 AND SET K=17

*
PROBLEM 14: OVERFLOW NOTRAP ENABLED WITH ROUNDING MODE=RP AND
   WITH A NEGATIVE NORMALIZED RESULT GIVES THE LARGEST
   POSITIVE NUMBER RATHER THAN THE LARGEST NEGATIVE
   NUMBER. ALSO RM, NEGATIVE RESULT GIVES PLUS INFINITY
   INSTEAD OF MINUS INFINITY

DATE FIXED: 27 AUG. 1980

DESCRIPTION OF FIX: FIXED TYPOS IN 'NOTRAP'

*
PROBLEM 15: THE INEXACT FLAG IS NOT BEING SET PROPERLY
   IN DECBIN.

   DATE FIXED:

   DECRIPTION OF FIX:

*
PROBLEM 16: THIS IS NOT EXACTLY A WART; BUT, RATHER, IS
   AN UPDATE TO MAKE THE PACKAGE AGREE WITH DRAFT 6.0.
   DENORMALIZED NUMBERS IN ROUNDING MODES RP OR RM WILL
   NO LONGER FORCE NORMALIZE MODE.

   DATE FIXED: 29 AUG 1980

   DESCRIPTION OF FIX: CHANGED GETPUT TO IGNORE RP AND
      RM IN NORMALIZE MODE TEST.

*
